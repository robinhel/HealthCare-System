# HealthCare System
A terminal-based healthcare management system built in C#.


## Patient
- Log in or create an account
- Book appointments with doctors
- View personal schedule
- Cancel appointments
- View medical records

## Doktor
- Handle booking requests
- View schedule
- Create and edit patient records
- View all patient records

## Admin
- Add or remove doctors
- Manage user permissions
- Create appointments directly
- Manage and save healthcare locations


## File Management
To make sure information is saved, we created a file management system where user data and different locations are stored in CSV files.
This way, the information does not disappear when the program is closed.
Currently, the system uses:
- Users.csv to store users
- Locations.csv to store locations
- In the future, we plan to add Journals.csv to store journals.
